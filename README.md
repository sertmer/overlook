# Welcome to the Overlook Hotel - A Solo Project for Module 2 at the Turing School of Software and Design
## A Hotel Management Application by Scott Ertmer


#### A Mod 2 Solo project intended to develop skills around:
* Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
* Work with an API to send and receive data
* Solidify the code review process
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

#### Abstract
The Overlook application is a Hotel application in which a customer can view their bookings, their loyalty points, and search for rooms filtered by type, and eventually book that room an upcoming date. A manager can log in and view their hotel stats such as vacancies, percent of rooms available, and search for customers. Once a customer has been selected, the manager can book a room or delete a booking for that customer.
